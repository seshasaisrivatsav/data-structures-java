/**
 * You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 *
 *  - On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock.
 *  - You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time
 *  - However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
 *
 * Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
 *
 *  Example 1:
 *      Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 *      Output: 7
 *      Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
 *          Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
 *          Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
 *
 *  Example 2:
 *     Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
 *     Output: 4
 *     Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
 *                  Total profit is 4.
 *
 *  Example 3:
 *      Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
 *      Output: 0
 *      Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
 *
 *  Companies: Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, Google, Apple
